# Getting Started with Jitsu and React

This project shows how to track events with [Jitsu](https://jitsu) and React app (with [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/)).


See:

 - [useJitsu.ts](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu-react-example/blob/master/src/useJitsu.ts) — simple hooks
 - [App.tsx](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu-react-example/blob/master/src/App.tsx) — how those hooks are used with react-router

## How to use

The app is based on a standard [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) template (with typescript support). Use
`yarn start` to preview an application
